# RtoAComp
Racket code to assembly

program -> compiler -> executable -> linker/loader -> run

Progression 
Definitions 
(define x 1) 

Functions
(define (square x)
	(* n n))

Need a assembler to turn program into tokens
From tokens need to check validity
Then need to create tree of tokens
go through tree and output assembly code
